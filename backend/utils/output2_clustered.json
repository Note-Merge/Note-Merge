        "If the tasks performed by environmental engineers were examined, it would be found that the engineers deal with the structures, equipment and systems that are designed to protect and enhance the quality of the environment and to protect and enhance public health and welfare.",
        " : Introduction to Environmental Engineering Any engineering project, large or small, a product being designed, or a services to be provided encompasses within its implementation a series of decisions made by engineers.",
        "Traditionally, engineers were able to practice their profession without having to address environmental ethics to the same depth that is now required.",
        "1.4 Environmental Engineering Definition: Environmental Engineering is defined as the application of engineering principles, under constraint, to the protection and enhancement of the quality of the environment and to the enhancement and protection of public health and welfare ( Sincero and Sincero, 1996).",
        "Environmental Engineering is manifest by sound engineering thought and practice in the solution of problems of environmental sanitation, notably in the provision of safe, palatable (tastes pleasant), and ample public water supplies; the proper disposal of or recycle of wastewater and solid wastes; the adequate drainage of urban and rural areas for proper sanitation; and the control of water, soil, and atmospheric pollution, and the social and environmental impact of these solutions.",

        "Traditionally, the environmental engineering has been the province of the civil engineering profession.",
        "Around 1968, the name sanitary engineering or public health engineering was changed to environmental engineering.",
        " : Introduction to Environmental Engineering In general Environmental engineering is focused on: Provisions of safe, palatable, and ample public water supplies Proper disposal of or recycling of wastewater and solid wastes Control of water, soil and atmospheric pollution including noise pollution Environmental engineers have the responsibility To plan, design, construct and operate sewage treatment plants to prevent the pollution of receiving streams.",
        "To carry out environmental assessment of projects and products To provide inputs in decision making regarding the environmental issues of development sector and welfare of public To predict the level of pollution and design control mechanisms and products One aspect of the profession of environmental engineering is that environmental engineer is engaged in a truly worthwhile mission.",
