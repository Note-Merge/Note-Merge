        "Professional decisions imply knowledge in a specific area in which the person is expert",
        "The professional is an expert only in his or her profession and not as expert at everything",
        "The professionals relations with his or her clients are objective and independent of particular sentiments about them",
        "A professional achieves status and financial reward by accomplishment not by inherent qualities such as birth order race religion sex or age or by membership in a union",

        "The professional relates to a voluntary association of professionals",
        "A professional is someone who knows better what is good for clients than do the clients",
        "The professionals expertise puts the client into a very vulnerable position",
        "This vulnerability has necessitated the development of strong professional codes and ethics which serve to protect the client",

        "We can do little about this risk and it is this type of risk that people resent the most",
        "In fact studies have shown that the acceptability of an involuntary risk is on the order of times less than our acceptability of a voluntary risk",
        "Such human behavior can explain why people who smoke cigarettes still get upset about air quality or why people driving recklessly complain about the bad road conditions",

        "Engineering typically find themselves working for an employer or client who requires that various alternatives for solving an engineering problem be analysed on the basis of the cost",
        "For example if a municipal engineer is considering purchasing refuse collection vehicles and finds that he or she can buy either expensive trucks that achieve great compaction of the refuse thereby making efficient trips to the landfill or inexpensive trucks that require more trips to the landfill how does the engineer know which is less expensive for the community"
