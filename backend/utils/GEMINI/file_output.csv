We add r redundant bits to each block to make the length n k r The resulting nbit blocks are called codewords
In block coding we divide our message into blocks each of k bits called datawords
We add redundant bits to the bit dataword to make bit codewords
<eos>","We add `r` redundant bits to each block to make its length `n = k + r`. The resulting `n`-bit blocks are called codewords. In block coding, we divide our message into blocks, each of `k` bits, called datawords. We add redundant bits to the `k`-bit dataword to make `n`-bit codewords."

In this coding scheme k and n
The relationship between m and n in these codes is n m
Calculate values of k and n that satisfy this requirement
Solution We need to make k n m greater than or equal to or m m
If we set m the result is n and k or which is not acceptable
If we set m then n and k which satisfies the condition
<eos>","In this coding scheme, k and n are parameters. The relationship between m and n in these codes is expressed as 'n m'. Calculate values of k and n that satisfy this requirement. Solution: We need to ensure that 'k n m' is greater than or equal to 'm' or 'm m'. If we set `m`, the resulting `n` and `k` are found to be unacceptable. If we set `m`, the resulting `n` and `k` satisfy the condition."

As we saw we have k datawords and n codewords
Later we will see how to derive a codeword from a dataword
Assume the dataword is
The dataword becomes the codeword
After flipping b ( changing the to ) the final dataword is
After flipping b we get the wrong dataword
