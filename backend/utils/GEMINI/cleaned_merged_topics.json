        "output": "The checksum is used in the Internet by several protocols, primarily at the network and transport layer rather than at the data link layer. The sender initializes the checksum and adds all data items, treating the checksum itself as one data item. An extra mbitbit unit, called the checksum, is then created by the generator and sent along with the message or data. For example, if the data is a list of five-bit numbers such as ( ), the sender can transmit ( ) where the last element is the sum of the original numbers. For simplicity, the receiver's job can be made easier if the negative (complement) of the sum, called the checksum, is sent, in which case the sender transmits ( ). The sender now sends these data items to the receiver, including the checksum. At the destination, the receiver can add all the numbers received, including the checksum. The checker creates a new checksum from the combination of the message and the sent checksum. If the checksup is all ones, or if the sum of all numbers received (including the checksum) results in zero, the message is accepted, assuming no error. Note that if there is any corruption, the checksum recalculated by the receiver will not be all ones. If the checksum is not all ones or not zero, the entire packet is dropped, or the message is rejected. Upon acceptance, the receiver drops the checksum and keeps the other data items."

        "output": "The Hamming distance between two words is defined as the number of differences between their corresponding bits. This concept is central in coding for error control, as the Hamming distance between a received codeword and a sent codeword represents the number of bits corrupted during transmission. The minimum Hamming distance (dmin) is the smallest Hamming distance between all possible pairs in a given set of words within a coding scheme. Coding schemes are broadly divided into two categories: Block coding and Convolution coding. In Block coding, a message is initially divided into blocks, each consisting of k bits, which are termed datawords. To form codewords, r redundant bits are added to each dataword, resulting in n-bit blocks, where the total length n equals k + r. These resulting n-bit blocks are known as codewords. For any coding scheme, three key parameters are essential: the codeword size (n), the dataword size (k), and the minimum Hamming distance (dmin). A coding scheme C is typically expressed as C (n, k), with a separate notation for its dmin, such as C ( ) with dmin and C ( ) with dmin. Error detection in Block coding is directly related to these fundamental concepts."

        "output": "To find the minimum Hamming distance of a coding scheme, one must first find all Hamming distances. For example, when a codeword is sent and a received codeword has bits in error, the Hamming distance is calculated as d(). If s errors occur during transmission, the Hamming distance between the sent codeword and received codeword is s. To guarantee the detection of up to s errors in all cases, the minimum Hamming distance in a block code must be dmin s; this also ensures the received codeword does not match a valid codeword. The minimum Hamming distance for our first code scheme from the table is dmin s, or s S, which guarantees detection of only a single error. For error correction, to guarantee correction of up to tt errors in all cases, the minimum Hamming distance in a block code must be dmin t. Error correction codes generally need to have an odd minimum distance, and a code scheme has a Hamming distance dmin. Linear Block Codes represent a widespread used coding scheme where the exclusive OR of two valid codewords creates another valid codeword. All Hamming codes discussed in this book have dmin; specifically, Hamming codes were originally designed with dmin which means they can detect up to two errors or correct one single error."

Sometimes, no error occurs in the received codeword at all. However, even when the received codeword is accepted and errors are undetected, the receiver might still incorrectly extract or create the dataword, particularly if the dataword is wrongly created due to the syndrome value."

        "output": "In one's complement arithmetic, unsigned numbers between 0 and 2^m - 1 can be represented using m bits. The negative or complement of a number is found by inverting all its bits; for example, positive 10101 becomes negative 01010. Another way to find the complement of a number in one's complement arithmetic is to subtract the number from 2^n - 1 (in this case, 1111). Notably, in this arithmetic, there are two zeros, one positive and one negative, which are complements of each other. If only unsigned numbers are considered, the complement of 1111 is 0000. Now, let us consider how to represent the number 15 in one's complement arithmetic using only four bits: 15 in binary is 1111, which fits perfectly into four bits. Other examples of four-bit representations include 14 (1110), 13 (1101), and 12 (1100). Note that in modulo N arithmetic, we use only integers in the range 0 to N inclusive. The previous example has one major drawback, particularly when a number, such as one whose binary representation needs five bits, must be expressed using only four bits. In such cases, the leftmost bit can be wrapped and added to the four rightmost bits. All words are added using one's complement addition; for instance, if a sum results in extra two bits, these are wrapped and added with the sum to create the wrapped sum value, which then becomes 0000. This technique can be applied when redoing Exercise 3 using one's complement arithmetic, especially when a number, such as one that requires five bits (like 2^5), cannot be expressed directly in fewer bits."

An error-detecting code is designed to detect specific types of errors, and other types may remain undetected. For instance, if a valid codeword is sent and one error occurs, the received codeword will not match any valid codeword, thus detecting the error. Yet, if two errors occur, the received codeword may, in some cases, match a valid codeword, leading to errors not being detected, particularly as a simple parity check decoder cannot detect an even number of errors. Conversely, sometimes when two errors occur, they create a codeword which is not in the table of valid codewords, enabling detection.

Some applications require that errors be detected and corrected, as data can be corrupted during transmission. The Data Link Layer, in particular, must be able to transfer data from one device to another with acceptable accuracy; thus, the chances of data being corrupt cannot be ignored. The number of errors and the size of the message are important factors in this context. Topics discussed in this section include Types of Errors, Redundancy, Detection Versus Correction, Forward Error Correction Versus Retransmission, Coding, and Modular Arithmetic. Note that in a single-bit error, only one bit in the data unit has changed. An error-detecting code can detect only the types of errors for which it is designed; other types of errors may remain undetected. In other words, if this code is used for error correction, part of its capability is wasted. The last error detection method we discuss here is called the checksum; however, we briefly discuss it here to complete our discussion on error checking. Related checksum topics include Idea, Ones Complement, and Internet Checksum. For example, suppose our data is a list of five-bit numbers that we want to send to a destination; if the result is 'it', it assumes no error, otherwise there is an error. For each case, we must consider what error cannot be caught and what is the error detection and correction capability of this scheme."

        "output": "A simple parity-check code is a single-bit error-detecting code in which n k with dmin; this simple parity check is guaranteed to detect one single error and can also find any odd number of errors. To detect the specific type of error that needs to be detected, criteria must be imposed on the generator g(x), as a good polynomial generator needs particular characteristics. In a cyclic code, those errors e(x) that are divisible by g(x) are not caught. If the generator has more than one term, its coefficient of x is such that all single errors can be caught. Furthermore, a generator that contains a factor of x can detect all odd-numbered errors. For instance, some generators, such as one capable of detecting a codeword with two isolated errors up to bits apart, can be useful, while others prove to be a very poor choice or useless. This involves finding the status of generators related to two isolated single-bit errors."
