            "For example if a municipal engineer is considering purchasing refuse collection vehicles and finds that he or she can buy either expensive trucks that achieve great compaction of the refuse thereby making efficient trips to the landfill or inexpensive trucks that require more trips to the landfill how does the engineer know which is less expensive for the community",
            "Obviously the lowest total cost alternative would be the most rational decision (Vesilind and Morgan )",
            "If a project is planned an estimate of the benefits derived is compared in ratio form to the cost incurred",
            "Should this ratio be more that the project is clearly worthwhile and the projects with the highest benefitcost rations should be constructed first because these will provide the greatest returns on the investment",
            "Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is an indicator to reflect the profit of the projects",
            "The IRR is the annualized effective compounded return rate or rate of return that makes the net present value of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from a particular investment equal to zero",
            "In more specific terms the IRR of an investment is the discount rateat which the net present valueof costs (negative cash flows) of the investment equals the net present valueof the benefits (positive cash flows) of the investment",
            "Internal rates of return are commonly used to evaluate the desirability of investments or projects",
            "The higher a projects internal rate of return the more desirable it is to undertake the project",
            "Assuming all projects require the same amount of upfront investment the project with the highest IRR would be considered the best and undertaken first",
            "IRR values of some of the projects Often the benefits of a proposed project are not such simple items as recreational value but the more serious concern for human health or other social aspects",
            "When life and health enter benefitcost calculations the analyses are generally referred as riskbenefitcost analysis to indicate that people or resources are at risk",
            "They have in the past few years become more widely known as simply risk analyses",
            "Risk analysis is comprise do risk assessment and risk management",
            "The former involves a study and analysis of the potential effect of certain hazards on human health",
            "Using statistical information risk assessment is intended to be a tool for making informed decisions",
            "Risk management on the other hand is the process of reducing risks that are deemed unacceptable",
            "In our private lives we are continually doing both",
            "Smoking cigarettes is a risk to our health and it is possible to calculate the potential effect of smoking",
            "Quitting smoking is a method of risk management because the effect is to reduce the risk of dying of certain diseases",
            "Some risks we choose to accept while other risks are imposed upon us from outside",
            "We choose for example to drink alcohol drive cars or fly in airplanes",
            "Each of these activities has a calculated risk because people die every year as a result of alcohol abuse traffic accidents and airplane crashes",
            "Some risks are imposed from outside and we can do little about them",
            "For example it has been shown that the life expectancy of people living in a dirty urban atmosphere is considerably shorter than that of people living identical lives but breathing clean air",
            "We can do little about this risk and it is this type of risk that people resent the most",
            "In fact studies have shown that the acceptability of an involuntary risk is on the order of times less than our acceptability of a voluntary risk",
            "Such human behavior can explain why people who smoke cigarettes still get upset about air quality or why people driving recklessly complain about the bad road conditions",
            "Thus for externally imposed risks it is essential to decide what levels of risks are acceptable",
            "Based on the these values calculation of acceptable levels of pollution is also possible",
            "This exercise ultimately leads to make a decision about the development of a project or an activity",
            "Engineering decisions are also based on the environmental impacts caused by the project activities which could be in planning implementation or operation phase",
            "In addition to the potential effect to human health and well being environmental impacts also include effects on the natural resources or infrastructures providing socioeconomic services",
            "While carrying out an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of a potential project a noproject scenario is referred against the various alternatives which helps to identify the environmental impacts and engineering or social mitigation measures",
            "Similarly life cycle assessment (LCA) of products is increasingly used in identifying the environmental impacts caused by the manufacturing process and use of the Traditionally engineers were able to practice their profession without having to address environmental ethics to the same depth that is now required",
            "Ethics provide a systematized framework for making decisions where values conflict",
            "Both the costeffectiveness analysis and the benefitcost analysis are methods for making decisions based (mostly) on money",
            "Risk analysis calculates the potential damage to the health and environmental impact analysis provides a means for decision making based on longterm effects on resources",
            "Ethical analysis involves values rather than cost or environmental data",
            "There are two theories leading to the ethical analysis utilitarianism and deontological",
            "A detail on these two theories can be found elsewhere",
            "An ethical perspective focuses on the attitude of people towards other living things and towards the natural environment",

            "Values Units and Dimensions A quantity is described by values and units",
            "Units simply describe what the quantity is about",
            "While measuring and reporting an environmental quantity both of these items need to be mentioned",
            "For example a river discharge of ms a sand particle of mm snow mass of km in the Himalayas",
            "In the study of environmental engineering it is quite common to encounter both extremely large quantities and extremely small ones",
            "The concentration of some toxic substance may be measured in parts per billion while the discharge of a large river may be measured with a larger unit",
            "on such extreme values it is useful to have a system of prefixes that accompany the units",
            "Specific symbols are also used to describe these quantities",
            "Dimension is a unique quantity that describes a basic characteristic of the measurement",
            "Mass (M) length (L) and time (T) are three fundamental dimensions",
            "Dimensions are descriptive but not numerical",
            "They cannot describe how much they simply describe what",
            "For example the length (L) dimension may be described in units as meters inches or Quantity Prefix Symbol pico p nano n micro μ milli m centi c deci d deca da hecto h kilo k mega M giga G Size and scale of measurement Substances Size μm mm cm m Bacteria Note meter (m) centimeter (cm) millimeter (mm) micrometer (μm) Concentration and density The mass density or density of a material or a solution is defined as its mass per unit volume or Where ρ density V volume In SI system the base unit for density is kgm",
            "Water in the SI system has a density of kgm which is equal to gcm",
            "Whereas the concentration of a substance in a solution is defined as mass of solute per unit volume of the solution (including solute and liquid)",
            "C concentration of A M Mass of material A V Volume of material A In SI system the basic unit for concentration is kgm",
            "A typical example of the concentration of total dissolved solid in a polluted river like at Bagmati at Teku is mgL or kgm",
            "Since solutes in solution are often analyzed by weight the terms milligram per liter or microgram per liter is used",
            "It is often assumed that the substance does not change the density of water",
            "If such assumption is made and we recall that mL water weighs g then The use of mgL is most common in water applications as the volume of the solution is usually determined as well as the mass of the solute",
            "The unit ppm is typically used in sludges or sediments",
            "TCE concentration in mgkg ppm and ppb",
            "Flow (discharge) rate The flow rate can be expressed as volume of the liquid per unit time",
            "Q Volumetric flow rate V Volume of the liquid T Time period In SI system the basic unit of volumetric flow rate is ms",
            "The flow of water is measured in units of volume per unit time",
            "Commonly used units for flow measurement are liter per second (lps) liter per day (LD) millions liter per day (MLD) cubic meter per second (ms)",
            "m L MLD Liters per day In engineering processes the flow rate can be either volume flow rate or mass flow rate",
            "Mass and volumetric flow rates are not independent quantities because the mass (M) of material passing a point in a flow line during unit time is related to the volume (V) of that Q M T (Concentration X Volume) T Concentration X Volumetric flow rate Mass flow rate of waste materials is also called as waste load which is often measured in kgday",
            "For example the BOD or nutrient loads of a wastewater discharged from a community",
            "Biological Oxygen demand (BOD) is measured in mgL therefore this concentration should be multiplied by the wastewater flow rate to get the BOD load",
            "Hydraulic Retention Time One of the most important concepts in treatment processes is retention time also called detention time or even residence time",
            "It is the time an average particle of the fluid spends in a container through which the fluid flows (which is the time it is exposed to treatment or a reaction)",
            "An alternate definition is the time it takes to fill the container",
            "Mathematically Let us assume a tank of volume V with Length L Width W and Height H and Q is the volumetric flow rate",
            "Let us assume v is the velocity of water flowing through tank",
            "We know Velocity (v) Distance (L) Time (HRT) Multiplying both side by Cross sectional Area (A) HRT (Since V AL and QAv) The average retention time can be increased by reducing the flow rate Q or increasing the volume V and decreased by doing the opposite",
            "In SI system the basic unit of retention time is sec",
            "The tapped flow is lps (liters per second)",
